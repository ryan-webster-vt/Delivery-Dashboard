# Delivery Dashboard
## Summary
The Delivery Dashboard tool utilizes R's Shiny library for storing information about an individual delivery (address, tip amount, miles driven, etc.) into a MySQL database via a user-friendly interface. Using this database,
a live connection is established onto a Tableau workbook such that the user can visualize their data through a dashboard to show useful information including summary statistics about their deliveries and a more in-depth
look into which day of the week provides the best tips and will attempt to forecast future tips made on a certain day.

## Instructions
* Insure that R, Tableau, and MySQL are downloaded onto your machine.
